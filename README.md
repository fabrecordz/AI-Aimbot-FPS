## ‚ùì What Is an AI Aimbot?

Lunar uses screen capture + YOLO object detection to locate enemies in real-time.

> It doesn‚Äôt touch memory or inject code ‚Äî think of it as a robot that watches your screen and gives you precise X,Y coordinates of targets.

üéØ Preconfigured for **Fortnite** ‚Äî some sensitivity tuning may be needed for other games.
