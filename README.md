## About

What is AI Aimbot?
Uses screen capture and an object detection AI model to locate the targets. Does not read or write memory. Think of it as a tiny robot that looks at your screen and tells you the x,y position of the players.


Lunar can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite - So some modifying to the sensitivity may be necessary.

Lunar LITE has been upgraded to be compatible with [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) through [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
