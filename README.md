# üß† YoloV12 AI Aimbot - Lunar LITE
I added a GUI to tweak the below configurations, and implemented a serial command so you can integrate it with a microcontroller (ESP32 is a great model)

## ‚ùì What Is an AI Aimbot?

Lunar uses screen capture + YOLO object detection to locate enemies in real-time.

> It doesn‚Äôt touch memory or inject code ‚Äî think of it as a robot that watches your screen and gives you precise X,Y coordinates of targets.
 Preconfigured for **Fortnite** ‚Äî some sensitivity tuning may be needed for other games.

**Summary**
üéØ Aiming and movement parameters
Variable	Purpose	Effect / Notes
xy_sens |	Legacy sensitivity constant	
targeting_sens | replaced by targeting_scale.
xy_scale |General scaling constant.  legacy.
targeting_scale |	Multiplier controlling how far the crosshair moves per detected pixel offset.	Higher values make the crosshair move faster/aggressively toward the target. Default 0.4 (in JSON) but overwritten to 10.0 in aimbot.py defaults
pixel_increment |	Minimum step size per frame when moving the crosshair.	Prevents zero-movement ‚Äúmicrosteps.‚Äù Larger = coarser movement, smaller = smoother (but more serial commands for an ESP32).

üß† Model detection parameters
aim_height |	Vertical aiming offset (divisor).	Adjusts where within the bounding box the crosshair aims (e.g., head vs torso). Larger number ‚Üí higher aim point (closer to top).
confidence |	Minimum YOLO detection confidence.	Lower value detects more objects but increases false positives. Typical range 0.25‚Äì0.6.
iou	| Intersection-over-Union threshold for overlapping boxes.

üñ±Ô∏è Input timing and control
mouse_delay |	Delay between incremental mouse movements (seconds).	Higher = smoother but slower. 0.0009 in code defaults; 0.0 in your JSON = fastest possible.
use_trigger_bot	| Automatically fires when target is locked. If true, script calls left_click() when crosshair overlaps target; false disables auto-shoot.
debug_mode |	Verbose console output.	If true, prints every movement, reload, and left-click to console. Useful for testing but slows down loop.

üîå Hardware / Serial communication
serial_port	Serial port used to send movement/click commands.	Must match your ESP32 or microcontroller COM port. Example: "COM2" You can change the port to any available one.
serial_baudrate	Communication speed in bits per second.	Must match firmware (ESP32 side). Default 115200.
serial_timeout	Seconds before serial read/write timeout.	Typically 1 is fine; not critical unless reading responses.

<summary>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Usage / Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

### If you get `CUDA IS UNAVAILABLE` error:
1. Make sure your installed CUDA version matches.
2. Visit [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install the right build.

Command for CUDA 12.6:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

---

### If the console closes instantly:
```
python lunar.py
```

---

### To configure sensitivity:
```
python lunar.py setup
```

---

### To collect training images:
```
python lunar.py collect_data
```
