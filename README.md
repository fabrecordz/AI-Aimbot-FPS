# 🧠 YoloV12 AI Aimbot - Lunar LITE




---

## ❓ What Is an AI Aimbot?

Lunar uses screen capture + YOLO object detection to locate enemies in real-time.

> It doesn’t touch memory or inject code — think of it as a robot that watches your screen and gives you precise X,Y coordinates of targets.

🎯 Preconfigured for **Fortnite** — some sensitivity tuning may be needed for other games.
