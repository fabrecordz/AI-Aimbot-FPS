# 🧠 YoloV12 AI Aimbot - Lunar LITE
I added a GUI to tweak the below configurations, and implemented a serial command so you can integrate it with a microcontroller (ESP32 is a great model)

## ❓ What Is an AI Aimbot?

Lunar uses screen capture + YOLO object detection to locate enemies in real-time.

> It doesn’t touch memory or inject code — think of it as a robot that watches your screen and gives you precise X,Y coordinates of targets.
 Preconfigured for **Fortnite** — some sensitivity tuning may be needed for other games.
